This repository is used to manage the code for our (The Explainables) group project in Explainable AI. 
During this project we investigated several XAI methods to explain predictions in a black-mirror scenario for predicting loan acceptences. 
We used the US Census dataset which can be found here : https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Explainable-AI-XAI-with-Python/blob/master/Chapter05/WIT_Model_Comparison_Ethical.ipynb
